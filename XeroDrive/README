Developed in Python, using the curses API, the XeroDrive data erasure and recoverytool is a front-end for the dd and foremost forensic programs.


Prerequisites:
* The program must/should be run as root.
* Ensure that dd and foremost are installed on the system.


Usage:
1. Ensure the correct name of the target volume has been determined before running the program.
2. As root, cd to the directory containing the XeroDrive executable, and use the following to run:
# ./XeroDrive


Data Erasure
XeroDrive uses dd to overwrite the target filesystem with random bytes piped from /dev/urandom. This should fully wipe the filesystem, but it doesn't prevent data recovery using file carving techniques in some cases. For that, the process must be repeated several times.


Volume Imaging
When attempting to recover data from a volume, it should be imaged first. XeroDrive will create a byte-for-byte copy of the volume and generate a file called 'xerodrive-image.img' in the destination directory.


Data Recovery
XeroDrive will use file carving to reconstruct whatever files it can find in an image file. This is an effective technique against accidental deletion and even some disk-wiping programs. The recovered files will appear in 'xerodrive-recover[timestamp]', and a log file called 'recoverylog.txt' will be generated.
